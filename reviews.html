		Love the way RS works. It's simple, logical, and builds up language skills in a progressive and effective manner. When used along with all the online tools - particularly the online live sessions, learning becomes a breeze.

		A terrific method to learn a new language
	</div>
	<div class="stars">★★★★★</div>
	<p>
		I have used Rosetta to learn Spanish and now Italian. I strongly recommend this to anyone who is interested in learning a new language. I have progressed very rapidly. It uses speech, some writing, breaking down of words into syllables, and a lot of repetition, all of which makes it very easy to progress.

		I'm learning Swedish and I feel like I am retaining and more easily recalling how to say things. I am not particularly gifted with foreign language skills and I'm pretty shy. Previously, I have felt insecure speaking the small amount of Swedish I knew. I cannot believe the confidence that this program has given me! Catharina, the live Swedish language tutor, is very patient and encouraging. I have recommended this program to anyone who is interested.

		I absolutely love Rosetta Stone, there are so many resources and ways to learn any language the success is really up to you. Just make time to do it each day or a a few times a week and you will learn the language!

		I took four years of high school French many years ago and decided to start with Level 1 so I could get a refresher course. While I already know a lot of the material in this level, it's good to build on.

		Excellent, organic program for learning a language.
	</div>
	<div class="stars">★★★★★</div>
	<p>
		Rosetta Stone uses the principals of psycho-linguistics to teach languages organically so that you are learning just as you would in the real world. Instead of mapping words out like a textbook, Rosetta Stone has you learn that word for what it is not as just a word. You see the picture and hear the word instead of having to go translate in your head back to your original language. It's a very sophisticated program, but it feels easy and fun.

		I went to Cuba!

	<div class="stars">★★★★★</div>
	<p>
		I married into an amazing Cuban family, but being a farm girl from Wisconsin, I only knew a few words in Spanish. Rosetta Stone has opened up an even deeper love for my husbands family by being able to talk to them. Last year I even went to Cuba and was able to talk! I now bought Rosetta Stone Spanish for our youngest daughter and my husband has talked about learning French, so this year for Christmas I bought him Rosetta Stone (the on-line version) French.

		Maybe the title of my review isn't the best, but it certainly has helped me progress in my pursuit of learning Spanish fluently. Rosetta Stone utilizes so many aspects like writing, reading, listening, speaking, etc. to fully make you proficient.
